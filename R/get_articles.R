#This is the download-function for the articles that have been retrieved by the get_spiegel, get_zeit and get_faz functions. With help from the function below, it creates a folder and pastes the queried articles in the folder.
#ATTENTION! This function will not help you with faz-articles as you cannot access the articles in the online faz-archive without paying a fee. Thus you can only have the headlines from those articles.

get_articles <- function(links, folder) {

  return(art_files)
  
}

# example: get_articles(zeit_df$links, folder="Ostern")


#This is the function behind the final function above. It is copied from Munzert, Simon, Christian Rubba, Peter MeiÃŸner, und Dominic Nyhuis (2014), but renamed.

# However, once you retrieved the links for the articles you can also download in any other way. But never forget being friendly!
